# Pavan FoodFinder App

**Simple modern FoodFinder** using TheMealDB free API.

## Features
- Search dishes by name or cuisine (uses TheMealDB).
- Display images, category, area, generated rating and generated address (for assignment requirements).
- Mark dishes as favourite (persisted in `localStorage`).
- Easy to upload to GitHub.

## Files
- `index.html` - main page
- `style.css` - modern styling
- `script.js` - front-end logic
- `assignment_page.jpg` - original assignment PDF screenshot (provided by user)

## How to run
1. Open `index.html` in browser.
2. Type a search term (e.g., 'biryani', 'chicken', 'pizza') and press Search.
3. Favourite items will be saved locally.

## Deployment / GitHub
1. Create a repository on GitHub named `FoodFinder-App`.
2. Upload all files (or push via git).
3. Submit the GitHub repo link to the Google Form.

## Notes for submission
- The app uses TheMealDB (free). If your instructor expects restaurant-specific data, mention that dishes are used and addresses/ratings are demo-generated to meet the assignment requirements.
